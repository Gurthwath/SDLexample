# SDLexample
An example of a project I wrote using C++ with SDL.  It's a simple platformer, where you can run and jump with WASD, double jump, and perform a quick dash.  There is an entirely custom window framework in place.  The basics of a spellcasting system are added, and Q will shoot a magic bolt which follows the cursor a short distance.  The systems were all designed to be easy to add content to; making a new window that can theoretically do anything, a new spell that theoretically could do anything, or a new level of platforms is simple. (making levels editable without having to recompile is a TODO).
